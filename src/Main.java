(5 pts) Part 1 intends to auto generate test cases for a function foo that has k integers as input arguments,
i.e., foo(int n1, int n2, …, int nk).
Each argument belongs to a different equivalence class, which are stored in a downloadable Eq.txt file.
The content is shown below and may be modified to handle more inputs and equivalence classes.

1, 15; 16, 30
1, 10; 11, 20; 21, 30
1, 5; 6, 10; 11, 15
1, 3; 4, 6; 7, 9; 10, 12
1, 12; 13, 24
For this file, the nth row describes the nth input. Take the second row for example.
There are six input arguments.
The data 1, 10; 11, 20; 21, 30 indicates that argument n2 has three equivalence classes separated by the semi-colons.
Develop an internal method “private int check(int val)” that returns the equivalence class the val is in.
The result of check(val = 3) for n2 will be 1 and check(val = 25) for n2 will be 3.
Regarding the function foo, it computes the sum of the returned values by the check function for all input arguments.

Follow the contents of the Eq.txt file to automatically create test cases for Strong Normal Equivalence class testing.
The input argument values are randomly generated. Store your prepared test cases to a test.txt file.
Each test case comes with an expected output at the end. All values are delimited by a comma.
In other words, Eq.txt is the input and the test.txt is the output result.
